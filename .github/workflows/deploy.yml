          # 1. Go to the project folder
          cd ~/bukizz-main-supabase

          # 2. Pull the latest code from GitHub
          git pull origin main

          # 3. Install dependencies and Build
          # (We use --legacy-peer-deps to bypass React 19 peer dependency conflicts)
          npm install --legacy-peer-deps
          npm run build

          # 4. Copy the new build to the public Nginx folder
          # (We don't need sudo because we changed ownership in Step 1)
          cp -r build/* /var/www/bukizz/

          # 5. Restart Backend (Optional, but good practice)
          pm2 restart all
